Getting started
===============

Connect your workstation to Panda
----------------------------------
The following contains is based on `FCI`_ documentation with only few modifications to adopt to our installation.

.. _FCI: https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/getting_started.html

.. warning::

  Be sure that you are in super user mode to allow the use of real time scheduling

you can do this in the terminal with:

.. code-block:: shell

   sudo su

1. Make sure that the Arm has been mounted on a stable base and cannot topple over, even when performing fast motions or abrupt stops.
2. Ensure that the cable connecting Arm and Control is firmly attached on both sides.
3. Connect the external activation device to Armâ€™s base and keep it next to you in order to be able to stop the robot at any time.

.. important::

  The workstation PC which commands your robot using the FCI must always be connected to the LAN port of Control (shop floor network) and not to the LAN port of the Arm (robot network).


Turn on your robot and wait until the light stabilises, make sure both emergency stops are pulled up as shown in the figure.

Verify that your Control's address is (172.16.0.2).

Control station configuration
-----------------------------
Open Panda Desktop and modify the Network as following:

Workstation network configuration
---------------------------------
.. figure:: _static/edit-connections.png
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center


After finishing these steps, we can open in chromo the address (http://172.16.0.2/) to access the robot desktop webpage.

Then unlock the robot's joints.

Switch to super user mode if you have not already done so.

You can test if the connection is established by the following commands:
.. code-block:: shell

   ping 172.16.0.2
   ./communication_test 172.16.0.2

You can launch a simple ros example by:
.. code-block:: shell

   roslaunch franka_example_controllers joint_position_example_controller.launch robot_ip:=172.16.0.2 load_gripper:=true
