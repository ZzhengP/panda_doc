Installation on Linux
=====================

This chapter describes how to install ``libfranka`` and ``franka_ros``, either
as binary packages or by building from source, and how to install a real-time
Linux kernel. ``franka_ros`` is only required if you want to control your robot
using `ROS <http://www.ros.org/>`_.

.. note::

   Only test the install on Ubuntu 18 with Ros Melodic.
